## Example Cloudflared config for Homebox setup
# Replace <YOUR_TUNNEL_ID> with your tunnel UUID and ensure the credentials file exists at the path below.
# Copy this file to ~/.cloudflared/config.yml after replacing placeholders.

tunnel: <YOUR_TUNNEL_ID>
credentials-file: /home/pi/.cloudflared/<YOUR_TUNNEL_ID>.json

ingress:
  - hostname: homebox.garrettorick.com
    service: http://caddy:80

  - hostname: companion.garrettorick.com
    service: http://caddy:80

  - hostname: labels.garrettorick.com
    service: http://label-designer:8001

  - service: http_status:404

# Notes:
# - When using Docker, run the cloudflared container on the same Docker network as the other services
#   (the provided docker-compose.yml in the guide expects `cloudflared` in the `homebox-net` network).
# - After `cloudflared tunnel create <name>`, a credentials file will be created in ~/.cloudflared.
#   Use that tunnel ID in the `tunnel:` field above.
